# Getting Started

<Meta title="Getting Started" />

This library uses [Stitches](https://stitches.dev/docs/introduction) and [Radix Colors](https://www.radix-ui.com/docs/colors/palette-composition/the-scales) for styling and theming. It is inspired by [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/).

The theme is included in the library. This is still a work in progress and support for extending and customising themes will be added later.
